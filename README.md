# learningRust

Learning rust so posting my programs here. I'm going through the book Blackhat Rust by Sylvain Kerkour https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust. My goal is to write code within the chapters and then add some additional features.

I don't have a plan of how many chapters per day or week, though my goal is to write some code every day, at least.
